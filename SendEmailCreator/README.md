# Auto Email Extended Actions
This plugin will add 4 new automatic actions to Kanboard.

*1.) Send task by email to assignee*

*2.) Send task by email to creator*

*3.) Send email of an impending due date*

*4.) Send email of an impending subtask due date to assigned user*
* This requires the [Subtask Due Date Plugin](https://github.com/eSkiSo/Subtaskdate) to function.

## Send Email to Assignee

This Automatic Action will allow you to send by email, a task to the assignee.

## Send email of an impending due date

this action will send an email of an impending due date to either the task creator, assignee or both. Duration is defined by user, i.e. 1 day would start sending emails of tasks when there is less than 1 day before due date.

## Send email of an impending subtask due date

this action will send an email of an impending due date to the subtask assignee. Duration is defined by user, i.e. 1 day would start sending emails of tasks when there is less than 1 day before due date. Subtask matked as "Done" will be ignored.
